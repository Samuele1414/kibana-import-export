This code is designed to make it easy to migrate spaces and associated objects such as visualizations and dashboards from one Kibana instance to another. For example, if migrating from an on-premises Elasticsearch and Kibana installation to an Elastic Cloud service, you may find these scripts to be helpful.

For a more detailed overview of why you may need these scripts see: https://alexmarquardt.com/2024/05/03/automating-the-import-and-export-of-kibana-saved-objects/
